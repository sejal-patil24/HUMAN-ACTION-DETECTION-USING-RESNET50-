# HUMAN-ACTION-DETECTION-USING-RESNET50-
This project focuses on detecting human actions from images using a deep learning model based on ResNet50. Below are the details about the project, its results, and future scope.

Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can identify various human actions from images. It uses a custom dataset of 18,000 samples, and ResNet50 was the primary architecture chosen for the task.

Key Features
Built a ResNet50-based model for action detection.
Compared its performance with other models, such as:
MobileNet
VGG16
EfficientNetB7
MobileNet achieved the best accuracy among all the models.
Challenges Addressed
During the project, several challenges were tackled, including:

Handling occlusion (where parts of a person are blocked or hidden).
Dealing with lighting variations across the dataset.
Future Improvements
To further improve the results, the following can be worked on:

Enhance the dataset quality by increasing diversity and size.
Optimize the model further to achieve better accuracy and speed.
Results
The comparison showed that while ResNet50 performed well, MobileNet achieved the highest accuracy, making it more suitable for this task.
